# Policy as Code with Intercept

## Overview

Policy as Code is the core principle of Intercept, allowing organizations to define, implement, and enforce policies using code. Instead of relying on static documents or spreadsheets, Intercept enables you to write policies as executable code, integrating them seamlessly into your infrastructure, software development lifecycle, and operational workflows.

## Key Features

Intercept's implementation of Policy as Code offers several powerful features:

1. **Multi-language Support:** Policies can be written using various Industry Standard formats providing flexibility and power to address complex scenarios.

2. **Diverse Policy Types:** Intercept supports multiple policy types allowing comprehensive coverage of different aspects of your systems and processes.

3. **Integration with CI/CD:** Policies can be easily integrated into your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, ensuring constant policy enforcement throughout the development lifecycle.

4. **Real-time Monitoring:** With the OBSERVE daemon, Intercept can continuously monitor your systems and trigger policy checks in real-time based on schedules or file system events.

## Benefits of Policy as Code with Intercept

### Consistency
Intercept ensures that policies are enforced consistently across all systems, applications, and environments. This reduces the risk of errors, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues that can arise from inconsistent policy application.

### Automation
By codifying policies, Intercept allows for automatic enforcement, reducing the need for manual intervention. This not only improves efficiency but also minimizes human error in policy application.

### Transparency
Policies written as code in Intercept are version-controlled, reviewable, and auditable. This provides greater transparency into how policies are defined and enforced, facilitating easier compliance audits and security reviews.

### Flexibility
Intercept's Policy as Code approach allows for quick updates and changes to policies. Organizations can rapidly adapt to new requirements, regulations, or security threats by modifying their policy code and deploying updates across their systems.

### Scalability
As your organization grows, Intercept's Policy as Code scales effortlessly. New systems and applications can easily inherit existing policies, ensuring consistent policy enforcement across your expanding infrastructure.

## Use Cases

Intercept's Policy as Code can be applied to a wide range of scenarios:

- **Security Policies:** Define and enforce security best practices, detect potential vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Compliance Policies:** Automatically check and enforce compliance with industry regulations and internal standards.
- **Operational Policies:** Ensure consistent configuration management, resource allocation, and operational procedures across your infrastructure.
- **Quality Assurance:** Implement code quality standards and best practices as enforceable policies.

## Integration with DevSecOps Practices

Intercept's Policy as Code approach aligns perfectly with DevOps methodologies:

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Policies can be applied to infrastructure definitions, ensuring compliant and secure infrastructure from the ground up.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate policy checks into your CI pipelines to catch policy violations early in the development process.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Ensure that only policy-compliant applications and configurations are deployed to production environments.

By leveraging Intercept's Policy as Code capabilities, organizations can achieve a more automated, consistent, and secure approach to policy enforcement, seamlessly integrated with modern DevSecOps practices.
