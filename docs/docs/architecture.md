Intercept provides an industry-standard, policy-based approach to security and compliance. It offers comprehensive capabilities to scan, analyze, and patch various types of files, systems, services, hardenings, setups, and endpoints. Intercept can operate in ad-hoc, real-time, or event-triggered modes.

## Policy Types

### SCAN Policies
Scan policies enable thorough examination of non-binary files for regex patterns. These policies are crucial for identifying potential security risks such as leaked or hardcoded API keys, SSL certificates, passwords, and authentication tokens. A compliant state for a scan policy is achieved when the defined patterns are not found within the specified target path.
### ASSURE Policies
Functioning inversely to scan policies, assurance policies enforce the presence of defined patterns. They utilize regex, CUE Lang schemas, or a combination of both. These policies are ideal for validating configuration files, log streams, and audit logs against expected patterns or structures. Compliance is achieved when the target matches the specified patterns, schemas, or values.
#### Configuration File Type Policies (JSON, YAML, TOML, INI)
For monitored files with specific target types, Intercept can generate patches to bring non-compliant files back into compliance.
#### Endpoint API Policies
API policies apply assurance policy principles to API endpoints, ensuring they meet defined standards and expectations.
### RUNTIME Policies
Utilizing a YAML-based serverspec toolkit, runtime policies validate server configurations and real-time system states. They are essential for monitoring services and configuration states, enabling immediate response to changes and drifts in compliance.
### REGO Policies
Leveraging the Open Policy Agent (OPA) engine, Rego policies assess compliance in complex scenarios. They excel in contextualized compliance checks where dynamic input data is necessary for accurate compliance status calculation.
