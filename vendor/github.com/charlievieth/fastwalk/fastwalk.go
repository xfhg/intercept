	// set when ran from WSL.
	//
	// I'm not sure what causes this, but it would be great to find a solution.
	// My guess is that when ran from a Windows directory it uses the native
	// Windows path syscalls (for example os.Getwd reports the canonical Windows
	// path when a Go exe is ran from a mounted directory in WSL, but reports the
	// WSL path when ran from outside a mounted Windows directory).

	// when running in WSL.

// Sorting may also help some programs that wish to change the order in which

// all directories before processing files.
//
// All lexical sorting is case-sensitive.
//
// The overhead of sorting is minimal compared to the syscalls needed to

	// This is likely the mode that programs that print the output of Walk
	// want to use. Since by processing all files before enqueuing
	// sub-directories the output is slightly more grouped.

	// while processing that directory all other Walk goroutines have finished
	// processing their directories, those goroutines are now stalled waiting
	// for more work (waiting on the one running goroutine to enqueue its
	// sub-directories for processing).

// Walk is a faster implementation of [filepath.WalkDir] that walks the file

// All errors that arise visiting files and directories are filtered by walkFn
// see the [fs.WalkDirFunc] documentation for details.
// The [IgnorePermissionErrors] adapter is provided to handle to common case of
// ignoring [fs.ErrPermission] errors.
//
// By default files are walked in directory order, which makes the output
// non-deterministic. The Sort [Config] option can be used to control the order
// in which directory entries are visited, but since we walk the file tree in
// parallel the output is still non-deterministic (it's just slightly more
// sorted).
//
// When a symbolic link is encountered, by default Walk will not follow it
// unless walkFn returns [ErrTraverseLink] or the Follow [Config] setting is
// true. See below for a more detailed explanation.
//
// Walk calls walkFn with paths that use the separator character appropriate
// for the operating system unless the ToSlash [Config] setting is true which
// will cause all paths to be joined with a forward slash.
//
// If walkFn returns the [SkipDir] sentinel error, the directory is skipped.
// If walkFn returns the [ErrSkipFiles] sentinel error, the callback will not
// be called for any other files in the current directory.
//
// Unlike [filepath.WalkDir]:
//
//   - Multiple goroutines stat the filesystem concurrently. The provided
//     walkFn must be safe for concurrent use.
//
//   - The order that directories are visited is non-deterministic.
//
//   - File stat calls must be done by the user and should be done via
//     the [DirEntry] argument to walkFn. The [DirEntry] caches the result
//     of both Info() and Stat(). The Stat() method is a fastwalk specific
//     extension and can be called by casting the [fs.DirEntry] to a
//     [fastwalk.DirEntry] or via the [StatDirEntry] helper. The [fs.DirEntry]
//     argument to walkFn will always be convertible to a [fastwalk.DirEntry].
//
//   - The [fs.DirEntry] argument is always a [fastwalk.DirEntry], which has
//     a Stat() method that returns the result of calling [os.Stat] on the
//     file. The result of Stat() and Info() are cached. The [StatDirEntry]
//     helper can be used to call Stat() on the returned [fastwalk.DirEntry].
//
//   - Walk can follow symlinks in two ways: the fist, and simplest, is to
//     set Follow [Config] option to true - this will cause Walk to follow
//     symlinks and detect/ignore any symlink loops; the second, is for walkFn
//     to return the sentinel [ErrTraverseLink] error.
//     When using [ErrTraverseLink] to follow symlinks it is walkFn's
//     responsibility to prevent Walk from going into symlink cycles.
//     By default Walk does not follow symbolic links.
//
//   - When walking a directory, walkFn will be called for each non-directory
//     entry and directories will be enqueued and visited at a later time or
//     by another goroutine.
